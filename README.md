# EDA-on-IPL-Data
Performed EDA on IPL Data using Python - Pandas and Visualization.

</br>

### Overview
#### This project involves analyzing and visualizing Indian Premier League (IPL) match data using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn. The primary goal is to extract insights from the IPL matches dataset and present them using various visualizations.

</br>


### Dataset
#### The dataset used in this project is matches.csv, which contains information about IPL matches, including the date, teams, match results, and more.

</br>


### Data Processing
#### Loading the Data: Read the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
#### Parsing Dates: Convert the date column to datetime format for easy manipulation.
#### Cleaning: Cleaning the data by removing null and duplicate values

</br>


### Visualizations
#### Distribution of IPL Matches in 2017
#### Created a histogram,barplots,piecharts to visualize the distribution of matches over the seasons.

#### Number of Wins by Team
#### Create a bar plot to visualize the number of wins by each team.

#### Distribution of Wins by Team
#### Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of wins by team.


</br>


### Conclusion
#### This project demonstrates how to use Pandas for data processing and Seaborn/Matplotlib for visualizing IPL match data. Through this analysis, we gained insights into the distribution of matches over time and the performance of different teams. These visualizations provide a clear and informative way to understand the dynamics of the IPL season.
